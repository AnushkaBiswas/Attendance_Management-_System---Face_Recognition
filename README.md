# Attendance_Management_System-Face_Recognition
A Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition Python is a simple python script that recognizes faces and mark attendance for the recognized faces in an excel sheet.

# ABOUT MY PROJECT -:
In my project, via face recognition technology, the face in front of the camera will be identified and matched with the database and if a match is found then under the detected face, the name of the person will be shown and the attendance will be stored in an Excel file with the name of that person and also the date and timing of the appearance of that person in front of the camera.


# TECHNOLOGIES / Strategy :
OpenCv - using OpenCv the image will be captured from the webcamera and will read the image.

face_recognition - It will recognize the image and will match with the dataset that it is present or not, by finding 128 unique face encodings.

Numpy- it will find the minimum face distance index. 

Django- using Django I will deploy the project in Web browser.
